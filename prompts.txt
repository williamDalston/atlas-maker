    """Prompt 1. Objective:

Create an eloquent, intellectually sophisticated, and deeply engaging script on the topic of '{input}'. The outcome should be varied and different from any other scripts we've made together. Don't use obvious patterns that an LLM would use, but keep it as if an analysis of the text would confirm it as human written. Use different vocabulary than previous scripts, nouns and verb choices, etc. The script should not only inform but also captivate, inspire, and challenge viewers, leaving them with a lasting intellectual and emotional impact. It should reflect the gravitas of a top-tier academic lecture while utilizing storytelling and cinematic techniques to foster connection and curiosity. The goal is to invite viewers on a 10-minute journey of discovery, guided by profound insights and surprising revelations. Do not speak with fluff; it should use rhetoric with substance, and details about the central chain of insights and studies or breakthrough observations, and the way practitioners think in the field. Do not use headers. I want you to give it all to me in a form that I can read it right away. It shouldn't sound like a speech, but like a very well-informed expert is having an intimate talk with the hearer.
